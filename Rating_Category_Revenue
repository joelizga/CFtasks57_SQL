Here is an SQL query to find revenue generation by movie ratings and movie categories

SELECT 	rating,
		CA.name,
     	SUM (P.amount) AS total_amt_paid
FROM payment P
JOIN rental R ON P.rental_id = R.rental_id
JOIN inventory I ON R.inventory_id = I.inventory_id
JOIN film F ON I.film_id = F.film_id
JOIN film_category FC ON F.film_id = FC.film_id
JOIN category CA ON FC.category_id = CA.category_id
GROUP BY rating, CA.name
